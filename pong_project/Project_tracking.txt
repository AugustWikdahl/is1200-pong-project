Implemented:
    Gameplay:
        Ball and basic bouncing
        2-player mode
        Paddle and ball collisions

    Options menu:
        Implemented difficulty selection "Hard" or "Easy". Stored in difficulty variable. 0 for easy, 1 for hard


Needs to be implemented:
    Gameplay:
        1-player mode with 2 AI Difficulties (menu is done, need the gameplay part)
        Advanced bouncing, implementation is ready to go, but outcommented rn since I cant get math.h (sin, cos) to work
    
    Options menu:
        Menu to select 1 or 2 player mode
    
    Highscore menu:
        Highscore screen after 1-player game for name input, 3 letters


Would be nice to do:
    Generally clean up the code, look at FIXME's. (Get the TODO Highlight extension for a better UX)
    Menu needs to have a better implementation, very ugly if-statement spam as of right now (it works I guess) menu.c
