Implemented:
    Gameplay:
        2-player mode
        1-player mode with 2 AI Difficulties
        Paddle and ball collisions
        Player can select the speed of the paddle in the options menu
        Advanced bouncing, (missing incoming trajectory part)

    Options menu:
        Implemented difficulty selection "Hard" or "Easy". Stored in difficulty variable. 0 for easy, 1 for hard
        Select player paddle speed
        Menu to select 1 or 2 player mode


Needs to be implemented:
    Gameplay:
        Advanced bouncing, (missing incoming trajectory part)
        
    
    Options menu:
        

    
    Highscore menu:
        Highscore screen after 1-player game for name input, 3 letters


Would be nice to do:
    Generally clean up the code, look at FIXME's. (Get the TODO Highlight extension for a better UX)
    Menu needs to have a better implementation, very ugly if-statement spam 
    as of right now (it works I guess) menu.c

Bugs:
    A bug when paddles are in a certain spot, the lower part of the paddle crossing over y = 16 
    and it doesnt display one pixel of the paddle
